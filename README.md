# 50projects
### Overview
This is a Udemy course from Brad Traversy and Florin Pop that is html, css, and javascript. It is laid out as a project a day for 50 days. Both Brad and Florin have Youtube channels that I encourage you to check out.

#### Base Project
This is just the base project files set up to make completing the course easier. This is just the basic html scaffolding that connects the style sheet and script file.

#### Expanding Cards
This is a quick, neat project that is a set of divs with background images. A active class is created with css and either added or removed from the div upon click with javascript. This active class will expand the size of the div and show a h3 placed within the div. Transitions and opacity values are addressed in css.
